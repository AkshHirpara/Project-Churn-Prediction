# Project-Churn-Prediction

This project focuses on Churn Prediction (Losing of Customers). Nowadays as competition have increased customers go for different brands for better facilities. The cost of retaining customers by giving them offers is more convenient way as compared to building a new customer base.
 The objective of this case is to predict customer behaviour. We have data which contains customer usage patterns and Churn Data whether customer has Churned Out or not.
